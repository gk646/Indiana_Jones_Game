# Indiana_Jones_Game
My own modified version of an Indiana Jones Game, based on a assignment from coding class. 
The GameView class was not made by me! Credit to my professor.

How to play: 
Your are Jones (J) on a mission to catch the holy grail (G) while escaping(E) the snakes (S).
When through the start screen you can choose levles by going into the respective gate.
Random is WIP
Right gate is WIP

Story Mode:
Has 2 levels so far. You carry over lifes until you die. 
First level, The Warehouse:
Get the grail first then head to the exit.
Second level, The Chase:
Dodge the incoming snakes until the lines happen.
Then your able to use your powerup (spacebar) to jump 4 fields to the front.
Try to hold out till you escaped.
