How to play:   
Your are Jones (J) on a mission to catch the holy grail (G) while escaping(E) the snakes (S).
When through the start screen you can choose levels by going into the respective gate.

**Story Mode:**
3 Lifes per try. In the end the level reset and you can restart so it doesnt fully matter.  
Level 1: Standard grail hunt.  
Level 2: Try to survive until the end.  
Level 3: PacMan! Get the pills in the 4 corners.  
Level 4: Puzzle with Notes, dont take too long!  
Level 5: Boss fight time. Shoot the boss and dodge the snakes!



**If you cant progress a level (some are not easy), you can copy and paste the checkpoints into the .txt(Checkpoint 1 for Level 2...):**

You have reached Checkpoint 1!  
You have reached Checkpoint 2!  
You have reached Checkpoint 3!  
You have reached Checkpoint 4!  

**Random Levels**:

Randomly generated levels based on a seed (you can see it in the window title).
